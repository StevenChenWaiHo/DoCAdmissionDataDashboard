# Imperial College London Department of Computing Admission Data Visualisation Dashboard

## Overview

This repository outlines a collaborative project with the Admissions Team at the Department of Computing, Imperial College London. The objective was to develop a secure, web-based data dashboard to support the team in making data-driven admissions decisions through clear visual insights and predictive analytics.

> **⚠️ Note:** The source code and datasets are **not included** in this repository due to confidentiality and security policies. This repository highlights the features and design concepts developed for the project.

## Key Features

### 📊 Visualisations
Users can select from multiple types of graphs to visualise different aspects of the admissions data, including trends over time, demographic breakdowns, and application funnel stages. The graphs are draggable, resizeable and interactable.

### 🛠 In-Built IDE for Custom Data Aggregation
A browser-based interface allows users to perform custom data aggregation tasks directly within the dashboard. Aggregated results can then be visualised immediately using the selected graph type.
