# Imperial Computing Admissions Dashboard

## Overview

This repository outlines a collaborative project with the Admissions Team at the Department of Computing, Imperial College London. The objective was to develop a secure, web-based data dashboard to support the team in making data-driven admissions decisions through clear visual insights and predictive analytics.

> **⚠️ Note:** The source code and datasets are **not included** in this repository due to confidentiality and security policies. This repository highlights the features and design concepts developed for the project.

## Objectives

- Provide a visual overview of application and admissions data across multiple years.
- Enable users to explore the data interactively through built-in tools.
- Predict future admissions trends using historical data.
- Allow for seamless handling of evolving spreadsheet formats over time.

## Key Features

### 📊 Visualisations
Users can select from multiple types of graphs to visualise different aspects of the admissions data, including trends over time, demographic breakdowns, and application funnel stages.

### 🛠 In-Built IDE for Custom Data Aggregation
A browser-based interface allows users to perform custom data aggregation tasks directly within the dashboard. Aggregated results can then be visualised immediately using the selected graph type.

### 🔮 Admission Prediction
The system uses historical data to predict the number of students likely to accept their offers and enrol at the college, supporting forecasting and capacity planning.

### 📁 Support for Evolving Spreadsheet Formats
The system allows users to upload admissions spreadsheets from different academic years. It automatically maps and reconciles differing column structures to maintain compatibility and ensure accurate analysis.
